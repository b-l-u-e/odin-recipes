        These chocolate chip cookies were very, very good. I have been trying chocolate chip cookie recipes forever to find the perfect cookie and this one is very close. They weren't too cake-like and they weren't thin and greasy, they were the perfect in-between cookie. That said, the add-ins are very important to the success of these cookies so don't get lazy and use chopped candy bars instead of chocolate chips. I've made these with M&M's, chocolate chips, and chocolate chunks and they are fantastic.
